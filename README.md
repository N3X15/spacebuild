# SpaceBuild

SpaceBuild is a Garry's Mod project that permits users to build spaceships, with simulated atmospherics and resources.

SpaceBuild is abandoned by the original developers. However, I have picked it up and will try to fix issues with it
when I come across them.  You may also file issue reports and pull requests.

# Available Versions

## Spacebuild 2
Probably broken.

## Spacebuild 3 - STABLE(ish)

SpaceBuild 3 is the current version of SpaceBuild that I know is working on GMod 13.  This is what the master branch uses.

There are still some issues, but it's now playable.  Most of the remaining problems are with some menus.

## Spacebuild 4 - WiP

SpaceBuild 4 is incomplete, from what I have seen.  It is also probably broken due to GMod 13.
