# SpaceBuild

SpaceBuild is a Garry's Mod project that permits users to build spaceships, with simulated atmospherics and resources.

SpaceBuild is abandoned by the original developers. However, I have picked it up and will try to fix issues with it
when I come across them.  You may also file issue reports and pull requests.

# Installing

To install:

1. Ensure you have a git client installed
  * **Windows:** Git for Windows
  * **Linux:** Usually a package called `git`.  Some distros may call it `git-core`, as well.
2. Open your command prompt (Run > `cmd.exe` on Windows)
3. Run:
```bash
cd wherever/you/installed/garrysmod/garrysmod/addons
git clone https://github.com/N3X15/spacebuild
```

The default branch is `master`, which is currently SpaceBuild 3.  To choose a different version, see the next section.

# Available Versions

To switch to these branches, use:

```bash
git checkout -B <branchID>
```

## Spacebuild 2
Probably broken.

<table>
<tr><th>Branch</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><th>sb2</th><td>Outdated, but may work for some.</td></tr>
</table>

## Spacebuild 3 - STABLE(ish)
SpaceBuild 3 is the current version of SpaceBuild that I know is (somewhat( working on GMod 13.  This is what the master branch uses.

There are still some issues, but it's now playable.  Most of the remaining problems are with some menus.

<table>
<tr><th>Branch</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><th>sb3</th><td>"Stable" - Updated less frequently</td></tr>
<tr><th>sb3-dev</th><td>Development - Less stable, more frequently updated.</td></tr>
</table>

## Spacebuild 4 - WiP

SpaceBuild 4 is incomplete, from what I have seen.  It is also probably broken due to GMod 13.

<table>
<tr><th>Branch</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
<tr><th>sb4</th><td>"Stable" - Not being worked on, though.</td></tr>
</table>
